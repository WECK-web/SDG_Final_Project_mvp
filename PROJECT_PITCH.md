# FarmConnect - Project Pitch

## 🌾 Elevator Pitch

**FarmConnect** is a digital marketplace that directly connects local farmers with conscious consumers, eliminating middlemen to ensure fresh produce, fair prices, and sustainable community food systems.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

### Current Food Supply Chain Issues:
- **🏭 Multiple Middlemen** - Farmers receive only 15-20% of retail price
- **📦 Long Supply Chains** - Produce loses freshness during transportation
- **💰 High Consumer Costs** - Markup can be 200-400% from farm to table
- **🌍 Environmental Impact** - Excessive transportation and packaging waste
- **📉 Farmer Struggles** - Low profit margins force farmers out of business

### Real Impact:
> "Small-scale farmers earn less than $2/day while consumers pay premium prices for produce that's already days old."

---
